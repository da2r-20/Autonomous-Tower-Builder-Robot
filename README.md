MagicalRobot
============

We are 4 Computer-Science students from Ben-Gurion University, Israel.<br>
This is our final project 
<br>
The project is to assemble a robot with relatively cheap parts and make it autonomous.<br>
The project is based on the IOIO framework which uses an android phone as a processing unit.<br>
the final goal is to build an application that takes an array of colors as an input, <br>
searches for cubes that has the same colors and builds a tower according to that array.<br>
