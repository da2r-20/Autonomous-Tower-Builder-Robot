RobotBaseProject
======

This project is a template for writing new algorithms for the robot 


See the `// ############### the new code goes here` comment in `src/ioio/examples/hello/MainActivity.java` file.

This is where you write your new algo code.


The android GUI contains only one `start/stop` button for executing and stopping the algorithm.
